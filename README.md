# Age Estimation with ResNet

## Introduction

This project aims to improve the accuracy and adaptability of age estimation models by leveraging the power of ResNet architectures. The current age estimation models, primarily based on PyTorch and convolutional layers, often face limitations in terms of accuracy and generalization across diverse datasets like UTKFace.

## Approach

Our approach utilizes a ResNet-based model to address the aforementioned challenges. ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a deep learning architecture that employs residual connections, allowing for the effective training of deeper neural networks. By incorporating residual connections, the model can better capture intricate features and patterns, leading to improved accuracy in age estimation.

Furthermore, we plan to explore the integration of data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness and adaptability across diverse demographics and image conditions present in the UTKFace dataset.

## Dataset

The UTKFace dataset is a widely used benchmark for age estimation tasks. It consists of over 20,000 face images with varying ages, ethnicities, and image conditions. You can download the UTKFace dataset from [here](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/).
